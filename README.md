# TruckMap Web Engineering Challenge

This project is intended to touch a few key technologies that TruckMap uses for its web applications to help us understand how you think about trade-offs between time, usefulness, and simplicity in a realistic setting.

We are respectful of your time. If we’ve requested you do this challenge we’ll pay **$200 for any submission** in good faith effort, regardless if you’re ultimately hired.

## Project Description

You will build a real-time React.JS chat room that allows users to log in and send each other messages and links.  Links shared in the chat should include a preview of the link inline with the message (think Slack, iMessage, or Android Messages).

## Requirements

- Use React.JS, Redux, and Socket.IO to build a real-time web chat app.
- Use Redux to store the application's state and process any client-side network requests.
- Links shared in the chat show an extracted metadata preview (page title, image, description/summary, or whatever you want).
- In the client, show a list of all users who are logged in to the room.
- Allow users to tag/mention other users in their messages - you can decide how this looks and behaves.

## Notes
- The auth login can be email-only for simplicity.
- We've included a basic redux boilerplate to get started, but feel free to reorganize this if you prefer another structure.
- Feel free to use any additional third-party styling or component libraries.

## What We're Looking For

- Modular use of Redux that contains the app's business logic (decoupled from UI components).
- Break up the UI into reusable components that follow either the React [presentational component/container](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) structure or Functional Components with Hooks.
- Consistent asthetic and look-and-feel of the app.  We will have design resources available, but there will be times when you'll need to fill in the gaps without outside help.

## Getting Started

We recommend getting started by downloading this package (don't fork, please!) and running `npm install` to set up the initial dependencies and app file structure.  You can start the initial app by running `npm run dev`.

## Submitting

- Replace this `README.md` with any instructions, a few screenshots, assumptions you made, and a few ideas for features you might add if the app was taken any further.
- Zip and email your repository to us.
- We will provide constructive and timely feedback on your submission with a clear direction around next steps.  Thank you for your time.
